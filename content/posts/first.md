I have been spending the last few weekends to decide on a blogging platform for my blog. Before I even started, I knew who were the contenders, but still wanted to check if new blogging platforms were available. The contenders were -

- [Medium](http://medium.com)
- [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) (as Go is my new favorite!)

I am a huge fan of Medium and on most days I learn something new from the articles posted there. However to me, Medium seems more _formal_ with _exceptionally rich content_. 

>It seems like publishing anything to Medium which is less than brilliant isn't acceptable. 

As I start off in my blogging journey, I need something which felt _easy_. 

On further introspection, I figured that I needed the following - 

- Write offline in my editor of choice (Sublime Text) with VI-mode.
- Minimalistic theme which just lists the article titles.
- A programming focussed blog (Medium seems to less targeted toward programming blogs).

I have always liked the minimalistic theme of [Tom Preston Warner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/)'s blog. However, this theme wasn't available in the Hugo community and after much deliberation I decided to port the Jekyll theme to Hugo. I am glad I did [this](https://github.com/isubuz/tom-hugo-theme).

I will still be hooked to Medium and as I write more frequently, I hope to publish to Medium with more clarity and confidence.
